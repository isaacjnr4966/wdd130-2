    <h2>Nickname:IJ</h2>
    <p>My name is Isaac. I come from Accra, Ghana. 
        I am very excited to be part of this wonderful 
        class to learn a lot. The thing I love most about 
        studying in BYUis the  desire the instructors have 
        for you to be able to suceed.
    </p>

    <p>I am a child of record. I love the church very 
        much and I have a strong testimony of the divinity 
        of Jesus Christ. I love the Prophet and apostles who 
        guide is in these our days.
